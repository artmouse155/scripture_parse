June 30–July 6: “No Weapon That Is Formed against You Shall Prosper”

Doctrine and Covenants 71–75
Ever since he was a boy, Joseph Smith faced critics—even enemies—as he tried to do God’s work. But it must have been particularly difficult in late 1831 when Ezra Booth began publicly berating the Church, because in this case the critic was a former believer. Ezra had seen Joseph use God’s power to heal a woman. He had been invited to accompany Joseph on the first survey of the land of Zion in Missouri. But he had since lost his faith and, in an attempt to discredit the Prophet, published a series of letters in an Ohio newspaper. And his efforts seemed to be working, because “unfriendly feelings … had developed against the Church” in the area (Doctrine and Covenants 71, section heading). What should believers do in a case like that? While there is not one right answer for every situation, it seems that often—including in this case in 1831—part of the Lord’s answer is to declare the truth and correct falsehoods by “proclaiming [the] gospel” (verse 1). Yes, the Lord’s work will always have critics, but in the end, “no weapon that is formed against [it] shall prosper” (verse 9).

See “Ezra Booth and Isaac Morley,” in Revelations in Context, 134.

Doctrine and Covenants 71

It can be troubling when people criticize or ridicule your faith in the Savior, His gospel, or His Church. When that happens, what do you do? Something similar happened in Ohio in 1831 (see the section heading to Doctrine and Covenants 71). What did the Lord tell Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon to do about it in Doctrine and Covenants 71? Maybe you could list instructions the Lord gave them and blessings He promised.

In addition to studying section 71, you might also explore how the Savior responded to His critics during His mortal ministry. Here are some examples: Matthew 22:15–22; 26:59–64; John 10:37–38. What do you learn from Him? What additional insights do you gain from Matthew 18:15; Ephesians 4:31–32; 2 Timothy 3:12; James 1:19?

How might His counsel apply to situations you face today? You might consider ways to peacefully correct falsehoods in your own words. For example, you might start by expressing respect for the other person’s views, and then you could share in a humble and kind way what you believe about Jesus Christ and His teachings. To prepare for these occasions, perhaps you could practice this approach with friends or family members.

Doctrine and Covenants 72

The Lord blesses me through the ministry of leaders like bishops.
When Newel K. Whitney was called to serve as a bishop, his duties were a little different from those of today’s bishops. For example, Bishop Whitney oversaw the consecration of property and permission to settle in the land of Zion in Missouri. But as you read about his calling in Doctrine and Covenants 72, you might notice some connections to what bishops do today—at least in the spirit, if not the specifics, of their duties.

For example, in what ways do you “render an account” to your bishop? (verse 5). In our day, “the Lord’s storehouse” can include the donations, service, and talents of ward members (see verses 10, 12). How can you contribute to that storehouse?

How has the Lord blessed you and your family through the service of a bishop?

See also Quentin L. Cook, “Bishops—Shepherds over the Lord’s Flock,” Liahona, May 2021, 56–60.

Doctrine and Covenants 73

I have many opportunities to share the Savior’s gospel.
When Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon returned from their missionary assignment (see Doctrine and Covenants 71), the Lord told them to continue their translation of the Bible (see Guide to the Scriptures, “Joseph Smith Translation (JST),” Gospel Library). But that didn’t mean He wanted them to stop sharing the gospel. After all, it’s part of the life of a disciple.

As you read Doctrine and Covenants 73, consider how you can make sharing the gospel an ongoing, “practicable” (verse 4)—or realistic—part of your life among your other responsibilities.

Doctrine and Covenants 75:1–16

“Labor with your might … proclaiming the truth.”
The revelation in section 75 was addressed to people who had “given [their] names to go forth to proclaim [the Savior’s] gospel” (verse 2). One way to study this revelation is to make two lists: (1) how to share the gospel effectively and (2) how the Lord blesses and supports us as we do.

What do you think it means to “tarry” or “be idle” in sharing the gospel? What does it look like to “labor with your might”? (verse 3).

Ideas for Teaching Children
Doctrine and Covenants 71

I can defend the truth by sharing my testimony.
You can use the section heading for Doctrine and Covenants 71 or “Chapter 25: Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon Go on a Mission” (in Doctrine and Covenants Stories, 96, or the corresponding video in Gospel Library) to teach your children about the circumstances that inspired section 71. Then help them discover in verse 1 what the Lord wanted Joseph and Sidney to do about “unfriendly feelings” toward the Church. How did He say He would help them? How can we be like Joseph and Sidney?

You could also sing a song that inspires your children to be true to the Savior, such as “Stand for the Right” (Children’s Songbook, 159). Help your children practice how to share what they know about Jesus Christ.

Doctrine and Covenants 72:2

The Lord has called a bishop to help me.
Reading Doctrine and Covenants 72:2 together could create an opportunity to discuss why the Lord gives us bishops (see also “Chapter 17: The First Bishops of the Church,” in Doctrine and Covenants Stories, 64–66, or the corresponding video in Gospel Library). You and your children could find pictures or objects that represent the responsibilities of a bishop. The picture and activity page at the end of this outline provide some ideas. Then you could talk together about bishops you’ve known and how the Lord has blessed your family through their service.

Chapter 17: The First Bishops of the Church: February and December 1831

Always teach about Jesus Christ. “No matter what you are teaching, remember that you are really teaching about Jesus Christ and how to become like Him” (Teaching in the Savior’s Way, 6). For example, when you teach your children about bishops, emphasize that they are representatives of Jesus Christ, called by Him to do His work (see 1 Peter 2:25).

Doctrine and Covenants 75:3

I can give my best effort to the Lord.
To talk about the difference between being “idle” and “labor[ing] with [our] might,” perhaps you could select some acts of service or household chores and invite your children to demonstrate doing them idly and then with all their might. As you read “neither be idle” in Doctrine and Covenants 75:3, your children could show how they would do the chores lazily. When you read “but labor with your might,” they could show how they work hard. Why is it important that we do our best when serving the Lord?

In his message “Two Principles for Any Economy” (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2009, 55–58), President Dieter F. Uchtdorf told two stories about work. Maybe you could share them with your children and talk about how it feels to know we have worked hard and done our best.
